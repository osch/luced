This directory contains the luced web pages.


Configuration
=============

The idea is to use this sandbox locally with the lighttp server.

The file index.sh is used as main entry point as CGI script for 
all pages. To configure the development sandbox the file
sandbox-config.sh must be present and must define the following
environment variables:

    BASE_DIR = the base directory for the web server, e.g.
               "/home/oliver/public_html/luced"
               
    BASE_URI = the base uri part of the web page, e.g.
               "~oliver/luced"

After configuring the lighttp web server as described below you then
simply may softlink the luced/web directory to ~/public_html/luced,
e.g.
        cd ~/public_html
        ln -s /home/oliver/luced/web luced



Configuration for lighttp:
==========================

add the following to /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf:

        server.modules += ( "mod_cgi", "mod_userdir" )
        
        userdir.path = "public_html" 
        
        cgi.assign                 += ( ".sh"  => "/bin/sh" )
        
        index-file.names           += ( "index.sh" )
        
        server.breakagelog = "/var/log/lighttpd/breakage.log" 
        

restart lighttp:

    systemctl restart lighttpd
