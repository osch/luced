LucED is a text editor with a graphical X11 user interface. 

The principal aim of the LucED project is to develop a text editor with the 
following features:

  * A simple and minimalistic, but powerful user interface that is similar to 
    the NEdit text editor, but does not depend on Motif
  * Fast and responsive user interface: e.g. syntax highlighting is done in
    the background and does not freeze the user interface, special handling to 
    achieve fast keyboard repeat rates
  * No dependencies on high-level widget toolkits in order to minimise the 
    requirements for the runtime system and to support slow network connections

The following features are already implemented:
  
  * Embedded Lua programming language for scripting and configuration
  * Syntax highlighting configurable via PCRE regular expressions, similar to 
    the NEdit syntax highlighting but with the enhancement to use arbitrarily 
    nested patterns
  * Full unicode support (works with UTF-8 internally)



This README file belongs to a LucED development sandbox directory tree. 

For further information see the file 

   ./web/documentation.txt

There is also a section [Building in a development sandbox] in this 
file, that explains how to build LucED with the development sandbox.
